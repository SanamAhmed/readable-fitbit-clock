# Readable Clock

**A Fitbit clock face with readable fonts**

There are some beautiful Fitbit clock faces out there, but I often find that the fonts chosen are too small for me to comfortably read. So I made this clock face with the goal of maximizing the font sizes for readability.

Tap anywhere on the screen to see the progress of all your goals:

Install it on the [Fitbit Gallery](https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/72882fa2-6aba-4a59-aee7-993dcb7e616d).
