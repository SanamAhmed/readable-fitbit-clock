# Readable Clock

**A Fitbit clock face with readable fonts**

There are some beautiful Fitbit clock faces out there, but I often find that the fonts chosen are too small for me to comfortably read. So I made this clock face with the goal of maximizing the font sizes for readability.

* The rings fill in as goals are met
* Shows your current primary goal activity value
* Shows each activity value by tapping on the primary goal icon
* Respects 12 or 24-hour clock display settings
* Compatible with the Versa, Versa 2, and Versa Lite
